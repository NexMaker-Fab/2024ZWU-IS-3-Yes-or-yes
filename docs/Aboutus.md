# TEAM INTRODUCTION
### Team Name

Our team name is Yes Or Yes.


The choice of the group name "Yes or Yes" is in the hope that the team members can make a clear decision quickly, without dragging their feet or hesitation when facing problems.

The name "Yes or Yes" also implies mutual support and encouragement among team members.
