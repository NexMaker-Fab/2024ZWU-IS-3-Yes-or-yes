    <a href="https://processing.org//" class="gw">Official website of Processing(processing.org)</a>
    <p>Processing is an easy to learn and powerful software that is especially suitable for designers. It provides simple and intuitive 
    <br>syntax and rich graphics processing capabilities, allowing users to easily create interactive works and motion graphics.
    <br><b>peculiarity:</b>
    <br>1. Ease of use: The concise syntax makes it easy to use
    <br>2. Community support: There is a large and active community where users can share and communicate with each other, and also provides 
    <br>opportunities for collaboration
    <br>3. Creative: suitable for creating interactive devices, data visualization and other visual art works</p>
    <section id="subsection1-1"><h3>1-1 The function of each part of the code box</h3>
    <img src="./iap-1/iap-1-1.png">
    <p><b>a. Menu bar:</b> located at the top of the window, it contains commonly used function buttons, such as documents, sketches, etc
    <br><b>b. Code area:</b> This is the main area of coding where users can write and edit Processing code.     
    <br><b>c. Output area:</b> located below or next to the editing area, it is used to display the output information of the program, such 
    <br>as the result of printed statements, error information and debugging information.
    <br><b>d. Mode selection:</b> Processing provides two modes: Java mode and JavaScript mode. Java pattern is used for traditional desktop 
    <br>application development, while JavaScript pattern is used for Web development. Users can switch modes in the toolbar or menu.</p>
    <img src="./iap-1/iap-1-2.png">
    <p><b>a. Start:</b> Start running the program
    <br><b>b. Stop:</b> Stop running the program</p>
    <img src="./iap-1/iap-1-3.png">
    <p><b>A. New:</b> Clicking will create a new window with a new, empty editing area where you can start writing new code.
    <br><b>b. Sample programs:</b> Usually contains a number of preset sample programs that demonstrate various programming concepts and 
    <br>techniques. Users can select these sample programs to learn and understand how Processing works.
    <br><b>c. Preferences:</b> Preferences allow users to configure various parameters of the Processing IDE according to their preferences 
    <br>and needs.</p>
    <img src="./iap-1/iap-1-4.png">
    <p>You can change the editor's fonts, languages, color themes, code indent Settings, and more.</p>
    <img src="./iap-1/iap-1-5.png">
    <p>The Run button is used to execute the currently selected sketch, the Adjust button allows the user to modify the Settings or      
    <br>parameters of the sketch, and the Stop button is used to stop the running sketch. These buttons are usually located in the toolbar of the 
    <br>sketchbook application.</p>

    <section id="subsection1-2"><h3>1-2 Processing coding method</h3>
    <p><b>1. Data Types</b>
    <br>Processing provides several built-in data types, including integers (int) floating point numbers (float) Booleans (boolean) 
    <br>characters (char) and strings (string).
    <br>  
    <br><b>2. Data Variables</b>
    <br>Variables are used to store data values, they must be announced before use, and can be local variables (visible only inside 
    <br>the function) or global variables (visible throughout the program)
    <br>  
    <br><b>3. Operators</b>
    <br>These include arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, *, /), comparison operators (e.g. = =, >, <), and logical operators (e.g.!). Etc.
    <br> 
    <br><b>4. input function input()</b>
    <br>Used to get a line of text that the user entered from the console. The function pauses program execution until the user enters 
    <br>some text and presses the enter key.
    <br>  
    <br><b>5. Output function print()</b>
    <br>Used to print any type of data. It can print strings, integers, floating-point numbers, etc., and can print multiple items consecutively.
    <br>  
    <br><b>6. Loop statements :</b>for,while,do while
    <br>Loop to execute blocks of code repeatedly.
    <br> 
    <br><b>7. Conditional statements :</b>if, else if, else
    <br>Statements can be combined to execute code based on multiple conditions.</p>

    <h4>Touch Designer</h4>
    <a href="https://derivative.ca/" class="gw">Official website of Touch Designer(derivative.ca)</a>
    <p>Touch Designer is a powerful real-time interactive visual programming platform that allows artists and designers to create complex 
    <br>multimedia content through intuitive node manipulation, which is widely used in stage performances, installation art, visual effects 
    <br>and more. 
    <br>The power of Touch Designer lies in its flexibility and extensibility, allowing users to customize various visual effects and interactions 
    <br>according to their needs. Whether you are an artist, designer or engineer, TouchDesigner is an ideal choice for the fusion of creativity 
    <br>and technology.</p>
