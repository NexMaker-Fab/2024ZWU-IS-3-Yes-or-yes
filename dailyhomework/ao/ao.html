        <h3 id="subsection2-2">2-Coding method</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Arduino coding basics</h4>
        <p>Arduino programming is mainly done in the C/C++ language, but in the Arduino environment, the structure of the code is somewhat 
        <br>different from that of traditional C/C++ programs. In Arduino programs, there is no main() function, but the setup() and 'loop()' 
        <br>functions are used as the starting point of the program and the body of the loop.</p>
        <h4>2.2 setup() function</h4>
        <p>When the Arduino board is powered on or reset, the code in the setup() function executes immediately. This function is usually used 
        <br>to perform initialization Settings, such as initializing variables, serial ports, I/O status, and so on. The code in the setup() 
        <br>function is executed only once</p>
        <h4>2.3 loop() function</h4>
        <p>After the setup() function is executed, the Arduino enters the loop() function, which is an infinite loop in which the code is executed 
        <br>over and over again, allowing the Arduino to keep working. In the loop() function, the main functions of the program are usually 
        <br>implemented, such as driving various modules and collecting data.</p>
        <h4>2.4 Sample code</h4>
        <p>An example of a simple Arduino program for blinking LED lights on a control board is as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
        void setup() {
            pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // Set the built-in LED pin to output mode
        } 
        void loop() {
            digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // Pull the LED pin level high to light the LED
            delay(1000);                     // Delay 1 second
            digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);  // Pull the LED pin flat and turn off the LED
            delay(1000);                     // Delay 1 second
        }
        </code></pre>

        <p>In this example, the setup() function initializes the built-in LED pin to output mode, the loop() function controls the switching of 
        <br>the LED light through the digitalWrite() function, and the blinking frequency through the delay() function.</p>
        <h4 style="color: red;">2.5 Announcements</h4>
        <h5>When writing Arduino code, you need to be aware of the following:</h5>
        <p>- Ensure that the Arduino board is properly connected to the computer and that the correct board and port are selected in the IDE.
        <br> 
        <br>- pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay() and other functions in the code are special functions provided by Arduino to simplify hardware control.
        <br>
        <br>- Debugging information can be easily printed in the IDE's Serial port monitor using functions such as serial.println ().
        <br> 
        <br>- Keep your code clear and easy to read, and use comments and indents wisely.
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsection5-4">Case 4:O Snoot</h3>
        <p>This is an innovative kitchen device designed to reduce food waste. It detects the freshness of food through a handheld sensor 
        <br>equipped with an aroma detector and a small camera. The device is able to identify and analyze volatile organic compounds 
        <br>(such as ethylene) released by food to determine if it is still suitable for consumption. When it detects that food may be 
        <br>about to expire, it offers recipe suggestions via a small lip printer connected to it, encouraging users to make new dishes 
        <br>using the ingredients rather than discarding them.
        </p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>1. It's practical
        <br>2. Fun interaction, such as printing recipes
        <br>3. In line with the concept of sustainable development
        </p>
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <p>1. Low accuracy and scope of application
        <br>2. Built-in camera has privacy issues
        </p>

        <h3 id="subsection5-5">Case 5:Vorkoster</h3>
        <p>The lid uses PH-sensitive film technology to detect ammonia from protein degradation in food. When the food starts to spoil and 
        <br>the concentration of ammonia rises, the film changes color to visually show the user whether the food is still fit for consumption.
        </p>
        <h4>Advantages:</h4>
        <p>1. High intuitiveness, clear color change
        <br>2. High accuracy
        </p>
        <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
        <p>1. Limited detection of food deterioration processes other than protein degradation
        <br>2. Maintenance and replacement is required, and the workload is relatively large
        <br>3. If different types of food are mixed together, the film color change may lose accuracy due to the mixed gas.
