    <h3>Magnesium（mg）</h3>
    <h4>1.1 Definition</h4>
    <p>Magnesium (chemical symbol Mg) is an alkaline earth metal with an atomic number of 12. 
    <br>It is a silver-white light metal with high chemical reactivity. Magnesium mainly exists 
    <br>in nature in the form of compounds, such as in minerals like magnesite, dolomite, 
    <br>and sepiolite.</p>
    <img src="./ma-1/ma-1-1.PNG">

    <h4>1.2 Properties</h4>
    <p>1-Low Density: Magnesium has a density of about 1.74 grams per cubic centimeter, making 
    <br>it one of the lightest structural metals.
    <br>
    <br>2-High Specific Strength: Although pure magnesium has a lower strength, magnesium alloys 
    <br>have a very high specific strength, making them ideal for lightweight applications.</p>
    <img src="./ma-1/ma-1-2.jpg">
    <p>3-Good Electrical and Thermal Conductivity: Magnesium has moderate electrical and thermal 
    <br>conductivity, suitable for electrical and heat exchange applications.
    <br>
    <br>4-Good Damping Capacity: Magnesium has good damping properties, making it suitable for 
    <br>applications requiring shock absorption.
    <br>
    <br>5-Biodegradability: Magnesium alloys can biodegrade under certain conditions, giving them 
    <br>potential applications in medical devices and implants.</p>
    <img src="./ma-1/ma-1-3.PNG">

    <h4>1.3 Applications</h4>
    <p>Magnesium and its alloys are widely applied in the following areas:</p>
    <p>1-Aerospace: Magnesium alloys are used in the construction of aircraft fuselages, engine 
    <br>parts, and more due to their lightweight and high-strength properties.</p>
    <p><b>Examples:</b>
    <br>1. The hull of the spacecraft may require high strength and lightweight, so magnesium and 
    <br>aluminum alloys with high aluminum content will be selected:
    <br>Magnesium aluminum alloy (Al-Mg) : In this alloy, the content of magnesium is usually 30% 
    <br>to 45%, the content of aluminum is 10% to 25%, and the rest is other elements, such as 
    <br>silicon, copper, iron, etc.
    <br>2. The internal structure of the spacecraft may require high strength and good thermal 
    <br>conductivity, and magnesium copper alloys with higher copper content will be selected:
    <br>Magnesium copper alloy (Cu-Mg) : In this alloy, the content of magnesium is 50% to 65%, and 
    <br>the content of copper is 10% to 25%.</p>
    <img src="./ma-1/ma-1-4.PNG">
    <p>2-Medical Devices: Magnesium alloys, due to their biocompatibility and degradability, are used 
    <br>in the manufacture of certain medical devices and implants.</p>
    <p><b>Principle of magnesium alloy in medical vascular stent:</b>
    <br><b>1. Biocompatibility: </b>Biocompatible magnesium alloys remain chemically stable within 
    <br>the human body without triggering an immune response and are not absorbed by tissues.
    <br><b>2. Degradation Mechanism:</b>When biocompatible magnesium alloys reach a certain age or 
    <br>are subjected to specific stimuli (e.g., X-rays, heat), they undergo chemical reactions and 
    <br>gradual decomposition into smaller molecules that can be digested by the human body.
    <br><b>3. Stability:</b>Over time, biocompatible magnesium alloys lose hardness and become softer, 
    <br>allowing them to dissolve readily through the circulation system and not cause tissue 
    <br>compression.
    <br><b>4. Regeneration: </b>Once absorbed, biocompatible magnesium alloys can regenerate through 
    <br>the body's own renewal process, growing into new bones or tissues.</p>

    <section id="subsection2-1"><h3>2-1 Liquid metal</h3>
    <h4>2.1 Introduction:</h4>
    <p>Liquid metal refers to a kind of amorphous metal, liquid metal can be regarded as a mixture of 
    <br>positive ionic fluid and free electron gas. Liquid metal is also an amorphous, liquid metal.
    <br>Liquid metal forming process and control, hydraulic characteristics of liquid metal filling 
    <br>process and flow conditions Filling process has a great impact on the quality of castings may 
    <br>cause a variety of defects, such as cold isolation, insufficient pouring, inclusion, porosity, 
    <br>sand, sand and other defects, are produced in the case of unfavorable liquid metal filling. 
    <br>The correct design of the pouring system makes the liquid metal fill the cavity smoothly and 
    <br>reasonably, which plays a very important role in ensuring the quality of the casting. Only 
    <br>mercury is a liquid metal, while gallium, rubidium, and cesium are low-melting metals.</p>

    <h4>2.2 Features:</h4>
    <p>1-Viscous fluid flow: Liquid metals are viscous fluids. The viscosity of the liquid metal is 
    <br>related to its composition, and increases with the decrease of the liquid metal temperature 
    <br>during the flow process. When crystals appear in the liquid metal, the viscosity of the liquid 
    <br>increases sharply, and its flow rate and flow state will also change sharply.
    <br>2-Unstable flow: In the filling process, the liquid metal temperature continues to decrease 
    <br>while the mold temperature continues to increase, and the heat exchange between the two is 
    <br>unstable. With the decrease of flow temperature, the viscosity increases and the flow resistance 
    <br>also increases. In addition, the pressure head of the liquid flow increases or decreases during 
    <br>the filling process, and the flow velocity and flow state of the liquid metal are also constantly 
    <br>changing, resulting in the unstable flow of the liquid metal during the filling mold process.
    <br>3-Flow in porous pipe: Because the sand mold has certain pores, the pouring system and cavity 
    <br>in the sand mold can be regarded as porous pipes and containers. When the liquid metal flows in 
    <br>the "porous tube", it is often not well attached to the tube wall, which may involve the external 
    <br>gas in the liquid flow, forming pores or causing the oxidation of the metal liquid to form 
    <br>oxidation slag.
    <br>4-Turbulent flow: Testing and calculation in production practice prove that when liquid metal 
    <br>flows in the pouring system, its Reynolds number Re is greater than the critical Reynolds number 
    <br>Re, which belongs to turbulent flow. For example, when ZL104 alloy is poured at 670℃ and the 
    <br>liquid flows at a speed of 50cm/s in a straight runner with a diameter of 20mm, its Reynolds 
    <br>number is 25000, which is much higher than the critical Reynolds number of 2300. For the filling 
    <br>of some horizontally cast thin-wall castings or thick large castings, the liquid flow rises slowly, 
    <br>and laminar flow may also be obtained. The study of the casting system of light alloy high-quality 
    <br>castings shows that when Re &lt; 20000, the oxide film on the surface of the flow will not be broken, 
    <br>and if the Reynolds number is controlled at 4000 ~ 10000, it can meet the requirements of the 
    <br>production of aluminum alloy and magnesium alloy high-quality castings. It has been proved by hydraulic 
    <br>simulation and real pouring test of aluminum alloy castings that the maximum Reynolds number allowed 
    <br>should not exceed 10000 in the straight runner, 7000 in the cross runner, 1100 in the inner runner, 
    <br>and 280 in the mold cavity. In summary, the main factors affecting the stationarity of liquid metal 
    <br>flow are the flow velocity of liquid metal and the shape and cross-section size of the pouring system.</p>

    <h4>2.3 Technology:</h4>
    <p>The paper "Multideformability of liquid metals between different conformations" reveals that liquid 
    <br>metals at room temperature have a universal deformability that can be transformed between different 
    <br>forms and modes of motion. For example, the liquid metal object immersed in water can show large-scale 
    <br>deformation, spin, directional motion under the action of low voltage, and even the automatic fusion 
    <br>between liquid spheres, breaking-remerger and other behaviors, and is not limited by the size of the 
    <br>liquid metal object; More unique is that a large liquid metal film can shrink into a single liquid metal 
    <br>ball in a few seconds, the deformation process is very fast, and the surface area can change up to 
    <br>thousands of times; In addition, under the action of external electric field, a large number of metal 
    <br>liquid spheres separated from each other can adhere to each other and merge until they fuse into a single 
    <br>liquid metal sphere. Based on electric field control, liquid metal can easily realize high-speed spin 
    <br>motion and induce vortex pairs in the surrounding water in the same state of rapid rotation. If the 
    <br>electrode and the flow path are properly adjusted, the movement mode of the liquid metal can also be 
    <br>transformed into a single rapid directional movement.</p>

    <h4>2.4 Achievements:</h4>
    <p>This research has opened up a range of practical applications, such as the manufacture of flexible 
    <br>actuators, the control of directional movement of target fluids or sensors, the recovery of metal 
    <br>liquids, and the use of microfluidic valves, pumps, or more artificial machines. If the electrode 
    <br>control of the space architecture is used, it is also expected to expand the intelligent liquid metal 
    <br>unit to three dimensions to assemble a biological or humanoid machine with special modeling and 
    <br>programmable capabilities; Even in the microgravity or non-gravity environment of outer space exploration, 
    <br>corresponding machines can be developed to perform corresponding tasks.</p>

    <section id="subsection2-2"><h3>2-2 Aerogel</h3>
    <h4>2.1 Introduction:</h4>
    <p>Aerogel is a kind of nanoscale porous solid material formed by sol-gel method, which replaces the liquid 
    <br>phase in the gel with gas in a certain drying way. Such as gelatin, gum Arabic, silicone, hair, nails 
    <br>and so on. Aerogel also has the properties of gel, that is, it has the effect of expansion, thixotropic 
    <br>and dissociation.Aerogel is the world's least dense solid and one of the top 10 emerging technologies in 
    <br>chemistry in 2022.</p>

    <h4>2.2 Features:</h4>
    <p>The density of this new material is only 3.55 kilograms per cubic meter, which is only 2.75 times the 
    <br>density of air; 
    <br>The density of dried pine (500 kg per cubic meter) is 140 times higher. The substance looks like solidified 
    <br>smoke, but its composition is similar to that of glass. Due to its extremely low density, it is very suitable 
    <br>for aerospace applications.
    <br>Aerogel is sometimes referred to as "solid smoke" or "frozen smoke" because of its translucent color and 
    <br>ultra-light weight. The new material may seem fragile, but it is actually very strong and can withstand 
    <br>temperatures of up to 1,400 degrees Celsius. These properties of aerogel have many applications in space 
    <br>exploration. Aerogel materials have been used on the Russian Peace space station and the American Mars 
    <br>Pathfinder probe.</p>
    <img src="./ma-2/ma-2-03.png">

    <h4>2.3 Product classification:</h4>
    <p>Aerogels can be divided into silicon series, carbon series, sulfur series, metal oxide series and metal 
    <br>series according to the main components, and can also be divided into single component aerogels (such 
    <br>as silica aerogels, alumina aerogels, etc.) and multi-component aerogels (silica/oxidized peptide aerogels, 
    <br>organic/inorganic composite aerogels, etc.). These different types of aerogels have their own characteristics 
    <br>and are widely used in different fields.</p>
    <img src="./ma-2/ma-2-04.png">

    <h4>2.4 Product structure:</h4>
    <P>Aerogel is a nanoporous network structure material. There are many experimental techniques used in the 
    <br>study of aerogel structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
    <br>are used to observe the structure characteristics such as particle shape and particle arrangement, and to 
    <br>estimate the pore or particle size quantitatively. The specific surface, porosity and skeleton density 
    <br>were determined by adsorption-desorption method (including BET, specific gravity meter and air porosity meter). 
    <br>Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) or small Angle neutron scattering (SANS) are used to measure the 
    <br>distribution and skeleton density of the colloidal particles (or network diameter) that make up the aerogel, 
    <br>and some special properties of the aerogel structure (such as fractal structure, etc.) are obtained. Low 
    <br>frequency Raman scattering can also be used to study the average particle size of aerogel network structure.</P>
    <img src="./ma-2/ma-2-05.png">

    <h4>2.5 Research field:</h4>
    <P>1-In the "863" high-tech intense laser research: Nano-porous materials have important application value. 
    <br>For example, the use of porous target materials with lower than critical density is expected to improve 
    <br>the beam quality of X-ray laser generated by electron collision excitation and save driving energy. The 
    <br>use of new porous targets with micro-spherical node structure can realize rapid cooling of three-dimensional 
    <br>adiabatic expansion of plasma and improve the gain coefficient of X-ray laser generated by electron composite 
    <br>mechanism. By using ultra-low density material to adsorb nuclear fuel, the high gain freezing target of laser 
    <br>inertial confinement fusion can be formed. Aerogels are the best candidate materials for the development of 
    <br>new low density targets due to their slender nanoporous network structure, huge specific surface area and 
    <br>mesoscopic controllability.
    <br>
    <br>2-As a thermal insulation material, the thin nanonetwork structure of silicon aerogel effectively limits 
    <br>the propagation of local thermal excitation, and its solid thermal conductivity is 2-3 orders of magnitude 
    <br>lower than that of the corresponding glassy material. Nano-pores inhibit the contribution of gas molecules 
    <br>to heat conduction. The refractive index of silicon aerogel is close to l, and the ratio of annihilation 
    <br>coefficient to infrared and visible light is more than 100, which can effectively pass through sunlight 
    <br>and prevent infrared thermal radiation of ambient temperature, and become an ideal transparent thermal 
    <br>insulation material, which has been applied in solar energy utilization and building energy saving. By 
    <br>means of doping, the radiative heat conduction of silicon aerogel can be further reduced, and the thermal 
    <br>conductivity of carbon-doped aerogel can be as low as 0.013 w/m·K at normal temperature and pressure, which 
    <br>is the lowest solid material with thermal conductivity, and is expected to replace polyurethane foam as a
