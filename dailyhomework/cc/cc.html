        <p><b>A. High Efficiency and Precision: </b>
        <br>Laser cutting can achieve precise cutting of composite materials such as carbon fiber, whether for flat or 
        <br>curved surfaces. During the laser cutting process, energy is concentrated, the heat-affected zone is small, 
        <br>the cutting speed is fast, and the cutting quality is high, thus realizing efficient, high-precision processing, 
        <br>greatly improving production efficiency.</p>
        <p><b>B. Flexibility and Adaptability: </b>
        <br>Carbon fiber laser cutting does not require physical contact, enabling non-contact processing, avoiding damage 
        <br>and deformation to the material surface. The laser cutting machine can adjust parameters according to different 
        <br>processing requirements, suitable for machining workpieces of various shapes, sizes, and thicknesses, with 
        <br>strong adaptability.</p>
        <p><b>Energy Saving and Environmental Protection:</b> 
        <br>Compared to traditional cutting methods, laser cutting does not need tools and does not produce cutting waste, 
        <br>thus reducing energy consumption and environmental pollution. In addition, since only a small amount of energy 
        <br>is required during laser cutting, it also significantly reduces the energy consumption of the equipment, in line 
        <br>with the trend of energy conservation and environmental protection.</p>

        <h3 id="subsection2-3">2-3 Advantages</h3>
        <p><b>a. High Precision: </b>
        <br>Laser cutting machines feature multi-axis control technology, capable of achieving precise three-dimensional 
        <br>irregular solid material cutting of carbon fiber, ensuring high standards of cutting dimensions .</p>
        <p><b>b. High Flexibility: </b>
        <br>Depending on different shapes and needs, by adjusting the cutting path and angle, it can realize the cutting 
        <br>of irregular carbon fiber material, meeting various design requirements .</p>
        <p><b>c. High Frequency, High Efficiency: </b>
        <br>Carbon fiber laser cutting machines belong to non-contact cutting, which will not cause physical deformation 
        <br>or damage to the workpiece surface, featuring high speed, high efficiency, etc., which can improve the 
        <br>efficiency of carbon fiber cutting .</p>
        <p><b>Stable Quality Control: </b>
        <br>Carbon fiber laser cutting machines have real-time monitoring and automatic adjustment functions, which can 
        <br>adjust cutting parameters and positions in time according to the encountered problem information during the 
        <br>cutting process, ensuring the stability and feasibility of the cutting quality .</p>

        <img src="./cc-4/cc-4-1.png">
        <h3 id="subsection4-1">4-1 An introduction to the process</h3>
        <p><b>1. Product details</b>
        <br>The turbine blade has a central symmetrical structure. 5052 aluminum alloy material is selected for CNC 
        <br>machining, so that the product has good forming processing performance. The overall anodizing treatment makes 
        <br>the surface of the processed product bright and beautiful, and the corrosion resistance, wear resistance and 
        <br>hardness are further improved.</p>
        <p><b>2. Processing process</b>
        <br>Milling with three-axis and five-axis CNC machining center ensures that the surface of the product is connected 
        <br>without cutting marks, and the deformation of the blade after machining is controlled within the accuracy range.</p>
        <h3 id="subsection4-2">4-2 The application of this process in industry</h3>
        <p>Turbine blades have a wide range of applications, and can be used for Marine engines, turbine parts, propeller 
        <br>parts, automobile parts, motorcycles, parts, mechanical parts, scientific equipment, etc.
        <br>The performance level of turbine blades is an important symbol of the advanced level of engines. Aero engine is 
        <br>a highly complex and precise thermal machinery, is the heart of the aircraft, the value of the engine accounts 
        <br>for 20%-30% of the value of the whole machine. In aero engine, blade is a special part, it is a large number, 
        <br>complex shape, high requirements, difficult to process, has always been the key to engine production.</p>
