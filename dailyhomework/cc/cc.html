        <p></p>
        <img src="./cc-2/cc-2-1.PNG">
        <h4>2-1 Advantage in aviation:</h4>
        <p>1: Corrosion resistance: SUS890L has good resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking (SCC), as well as 
        <br>excellent resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion, which makes it perform well in harsh chemical 
        <br>environments. </p>
        <p>2: High temperature strength: This material can still maintain high strength and good mechanical properties at 
        <br>high temperatures, suitable for high temperature working environment. </p>
        <p>3: Processing performance: SUS890L has good malleability and weldability, which is easy to process and manufacture.</p>
        <h4>2-2 Key points in laser cutting</h4>
        <p>1: Adjustment of cutting parameters: including cutting height, nozzle type, focus position, cutting power, cutting 
        <br>duty ratio, cutting pressure and cutting speed. The reasonable setting of these parameters is very important to 
        <br>ensure the cutting quality and efficiency.</p>
        <p>2: Inspection of hardware conditions: including protective lenses, gas purity, plate quality, aggregation mirrors and 
        <br>collimators. The state of these hardware conditions directly affects the effect and safety of laser cutting.</p>
        <p>3: Problem solving in the cutting process: For example, hanging slag occurs during cutting, and cutting parameters 
        <br>may need to be adjusted or the nozzle replaced. If the cut section is not bright or rough enough, it may be necessary 
        <br>to improve the quality of the plate or improve the purity of the gas.</p>
        <p>4: The use of auxiliary gases: In the laser cutting process, the use of auxiliary gases such as nitrogen, oxygen 
        <br>or compressed air can help improve cutting quality and efficiency. Nitrogen is one of the commonly used auxiliary 
        <br>gases because it can prevent the oxidation of the material and obtain the ideal cutting effect.</p>

        <h3 id="subsection5-1">5-1 An introduction to the machine</h3>
        <p>CNC lathe is one of the most widely used CNC machine tools. It is mainly used for the internal and external 
        <br>cylindrical surface of shaft parts or disk parts, the internal and external conical surface of any cone Angle, 
        <br>complex rotary internal and external surface and cylinder, taper thread, etc., and can be cut, drilling, reaming, 
        <br>reaming and boring. CNC machine tool is in accordance with the pre-prepared processing program, automatic 
        <br>processing of the parts to be processed. We put the parts of the processing process route, process parameters, 
        <br>tool trajectory, displacement, cutting parameters and auxiliary functions, in accordance with the instructions 
        <br>of the CNC machine tool code and program format written into the processing program, and then the content of 
        <br>the program in the single record in the control medium, and then input into the CNC machine tool CNC device, 
        <br>so as to command the machine tool processing parts. In July 2023, 25 of the Second Academy of Aerospace Science 
        <br>and Industry successfully developed a high-precision optical automatic centering CNC lathe integrating optical

        <h4>a. Selection principle</h4>
        <h5>a.1 Preliminary preparation</h5>
        <p>Determine the process requirements of typical parts, the batch of processing workpiece, the function of CNC 
        <br>lathes should be prepared in the early stage, and the prerequisite for reasonable selection of CNC lathes is 
        <br>to meet the process requirements of typical parts.
        <br>The process requirements of typical parts are mainly the structural size, processing range and precision 
        <br>requirements of the parts. According to the accuracy requirements, that is, the dimensional accuracy of the 
        <br>workpiece, the positioning accuracy and the surface roughness requirements to choose the control accuracy of 
        <br>the CNC lathe. Choose according to reliability, which is the guarantee of improving product quality and 
        <br>production efficiency. The reliability of CNC machine tools means that when the machine tools perform their 
        <br>functions under specified conditions, they run stably for a long time without failure. That is, the average 
        <br>trouble-free time is long, and even if there is a fault, it can be recovered in a short time and put back into 
        <br>use. Choose a machine tool with reasonable structure, excellent manufacturing and mass production. In general, 
        <br>the more users, the higher the reliability of the numerical control system.</p>
        <img src="./cc-5/cnc-5-2.webp">
        <h5>a.2 Machine tool accessories and tools</h5>
        <p>Machine tool accessories, spare parts and their supply capacity, cutting tools, have been put into production 
        <br>CNC lathes, turning centers are very important. When choosing a machine tool, you need to carefully consider 
        <br>the compatibility of tools and accessories.</p>
        <img src="./cc-5/cnc-5-3.webp">
        <h5>a.3 Control system</h5>
        <p>Manufacturers generally choose the same manufacturer's products, at least should buy the same manufacturer's 
        <br>control system, which brings great convenience to the maintenance work. Teaching units, due to the need for 
        <br>students to be well-informed, choose different systems, equipped with a variety of simulation software is a 
        <br>wise choice. </p>
        <img src="./cc-5/cnc-5-4.webp">
        <h5>a.4 Performance price ratio to choose</h5>
        <p>Do not idle, do not waste, do not choose functions unrelated to their own needs.</p>
        <img src="./cc-5/cnc-5-5.webp">
        <h5>a.5 Machine tool protection</h5>
        <p>When necessary, the machine can be equipped with fully enclosed or semi-enclosed protective devices, automatic 
        <br>chip removal devices.
        <br>When choosing CNC lathes and turning centers, the above principles should be considered comprehensively.</p>
        <h4>b. peculiarity</h4>
        <p>Numerical control machine tool is short for digital control machine tool, is a kind of automatic machine tool 
        <br>equipped with program control system. The control system can logically process and decode programs with control 
        <br>codes or other symbolic instructions, so as to make the machine move and process parts.
        <br>Compared with ordinary machine tools, CNC machine tools have the following characteristics:
        <br>1. High processing precision and stable processing quality;
        <br>2. Can carry out multi-coordinate linkage, can process complex shape parts;
        <br>3. When machining parts change, generally only need to change the numerical control program, which can save 
        <br>production preparation time;
        <br>4. The machine itself has high precision, large rigidity, can choose favorable processing amount, and high 
        <br>productivity (generally 3 to 5 times of ordinary machine tools);
        <br>5. High degree of machine automation, can reduce labor intensity;
        <br>6. Higher requirements for the quality of operators and higher technical requirements for maintenance personnel.</p>
        <img src="./cc-5/cnc-5-6.webp">
        <h4>c. Tooling lathe</h4>
        <h5>c.1 Determine the processing route</h5>
        <p>he machining route is the movement path and direction of the tool relative to the part during the processing of 
        <br>the exponential control machine tool.
        <br>1, should be able to ensure the processing accuracy and surface roughness requirements;
        <br>2, should try to shorten the processing route, reduce the tool empty travel time.</p>
        <h5>c.2 The connection between the processing route and the processing allowance</h5>
        <p>Under the condition that the CNC lathe has not yet reached the popular use, the excess margin on the blank should 
        <br>generally be arranged on the ordinary lathe processing, especially the margin containing the forging and casting 
        <br>hard skin. If you must use CNC lathe processing, you need to pay attention to the flexible arrangement of the 
        <br>program.</p>
        <h5>c.3 Fixture installation points</h5>
        <p>The connection between the hydraulic chuck and the hydraulic clamp cylinder is realized by the pull rod. The critical 
        <br>points of the hydraulic chuck clamp are as follows: First remove the nut on the hydraulic cylinder with the lift 
        <br>hand, remove the pull pipe, and pull it out from the rear end of the spindle, and then remove the chuck fixing screw 
        <br>with the lift hand.</p>
