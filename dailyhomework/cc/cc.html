        <h3>1. Eye protection: </h3>
        <p>Eye protection: The laser cutting process will produce a strong light beam, the operator must wear special laser 
        <br>protective glasses to prevent eye injury.
        <br>Protection wavelength:
        <br>200-450nm (UV, violet, Blue)
        <br>800-2000nm (Infrared)
        <br>1064nm (Fiber laser marking machine wavelength)</p>

        <h3>2. Skin protection: </h3>
        <p>the beam generated by laser cutting and the splashing molten material may cause damage to the skin, and the operator 
        <br>should wear appropriate protective clothing.</p>
        <h3>3. Environmental control: </h3>
        <p>to operate in a well-ventilated environment to reduce the inhalation of harmful fumes and gases.</p>
        <img src="./cc-1/cc-4.png">
        <h3>4. Emergency stop switch: </h3>
        <p>Ensure that the emergency stop switch is equipped to stop in time in case of special danger.</p>

        <h3>Laser cutting material</h3>
        <h4>316 stainless steel material</h4>

        <h5>After laser cutting</h5>
        <img src="./cc-2/cc-2-2.PNG">
        <h5>2-1 Advantage in aviation:</h5>
        <p>1: Corrosion resistance: SUS890L has good resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking (SCC), as well as 
        <br>excellent resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion, which makes it perform well in harsh chemical 
        <br>environments. </p>
        <p>2: High temperature strength: This material can still maintain high strength and good mechanical properties at 
        <br>high temperatures, suitable for high temperature working environment. </p>
        <p>3: Processing performance: SUS890L has good malleability and weldability, which is easy to process and manufacture.</p>
        <h5>2-2 Key points in laser cutting</h5>
        <p>1: Adjustment of cutting parameters: including cutting height, nozzle type, focus position, cutting power, cutting 
        <br>duty ratio, cutting pressure and cutting speed. The reasonable setting of these parameters is very important to 
        <br>ensure the cutting quality and efficiency.</p>
        <p>2: Inspection of hardware conditions: including protective lenses, gas purity, plate quality, aggregation mirrors and 
        <br>collimators. The state of these hardware conditions directly affects the effect and safety of laser cutting.</p>
        <p>3: Problem solving in the cutting process: For example, hanging slag occurs during cutting, and cutting parameters 
        <br>may need to be adjusted or the nozzle replaced. If the cut section is not bright or rough enough, it may be necessary 
        <br>to improve the quality of the plate or improve the purity of the gas.</p>
        <p>4: The use of auxiliary gases: In the laser cutting process, the use of auxiliary gases such as nitrogen, oxygen 
        <br>or compressed air can help improve cutting quality and efficiency. Nitrogen is one of the commonly used auxiliary 
        <br>gases because it can prevent the oxidation of the material and obtain the ideal cutting effect.</p>

        <h3>1. Safety procedures: </h3>
        <p>The moving parts of CNC machine tools may cause splint injuries or other physical injuries, and the operator 
        <br>should follow the safety procedures during operation.</p>
        <h3>2. Cutting fluid treatment: </h3>
        <p>replace or treat cutting fluid regularly to prevent deterioration and harmful substances.</p>

        <h2 id="section4">04-CNC process introduction</h2>
        <h3>Design CAD drawings: </h3>
        <p>First, design a 3D model of the part using computer aided design (CAD) software.</p>
        <img src="./cc-4/CN-4-1.png">
        <h3>Write CAM program: </h3>
        <p>According to the CAD model, use computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software to generate the machining program 
        <br>required for CNC machine tools.</p>
        <img src="./cc-4/CN-4-2.png">
        <h3>Prepare the raw materials: </h3>
        <p>Fix the stainless steel sheet on the work table of the CNC machine.</p>
