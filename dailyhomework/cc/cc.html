        <h3>1. Eye protection: </h3>
        <p>The laser cutting process will produce a strong light beam, the operator must wear special laser protective glasses 
        <br>to prevent eye injury.</p>
        <img src="./cc-1/cc-1.png">
        <img src="./cc-1/cc-2.jpg">
        <h3>2. Skin protection: </h3>
        <p>the beam generated by laser cutting and the splashing molten material may cause damage to the skin, and the operator 
        <br>should wear appropriate protective clothing.</p>
        <img src="./cc-1/cc-3.png">
        <h3>3. Environmental control: </h3>
        <p>to operate in a well-ventilated environment to reduce the inhalation of harmful fumes and gases.</p>
        <img src="./cc-1/cc-4.jpg">
        <h3>4. Emergency stop switch: </h3>
        <p>Ensure that the emergency stop switch is equipped to stop in time in case of special danger.</p>

        <h2 id="section2">02-Laser cutting material</h2>
        <h3>SUS890L stainless steel material</h3>
        <p></p>
        <img src="./cc-2/cc-2-1.PNG">
        <h4>2-1 Advantage in aviation:</h4>
        <p>1: Corrosion resistance: SUS890L has good resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking (SCC), as well as 
        <br>excellent resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion, which makes it perform well in harsh chemical 
        <br>environments. </p>
        <p>2: High temperature strength: This material can still maintain high strength and good mechanical properties at 
        <br>high temperatures, suitable for high temperature working environment. </p>
        <p>3: Processing performance: SUS890L has good malleability and weldability, which is easy to process and manufacture.</p>
        <h4>2-2 Key points in laser cutting</h4>
        <p>1: Adjustment of cutting parameters: including cutting height, nozzle type, focus position, cutting power, cutting 
        <br>duty ratio, cutting pressure and cutting speed. The reasonable setting of these parameters is very important to 
        <br>ensure the cutting quality and efficiency.</p>
        <p>2: Inspection of hardware conditions: including protective lenses, gas purity, plate quality, aggregation mirrors and 
        <br>collimators. The state of these hardware conditions directly affects the effect and safety of laser cutting.</p>
        <p>3: Problem solving in the cutting process: For example, hanging slag occurs during cutting, and cutting parameters 
        <br>may need to be adjusted or the nozzle replaced. If the cut section is not bright or rough enough, it may be necessary 
        <br>to improve the quality of the plate or improve the purity of the gas.</p>
        <p>4: The use of auxiliary gases: In the laser cutting process, the use of auxiliary gases such as nitrogen, oxygen 
        <br>or compressed air can help improve cutting quality and efficiency. Nitrogen is one of the commonly used auxiliary 
        <br>gases because it can prevent the oxidation of the material and obtain the ideal cutting effect.</p>

        <h3>1. Protective equipment: </h3>
        <p>The cutting fluid used in CNC machining may cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, and the operator 
        <br>should wear gloves and other protective equipment.</p>
        <img src="./cc-3/cc-1.jpg">
        <h3>1. Safety procedures: </h3>
        <p>The moving parts of CNC machine tools may cause splint injuries or other physical injuries, and the operator 
        <br>should follow the safety procedures during operation.</p>
        <h3>1. Cutting fluid treatment: </h3>
        <p>replace or treat cutting fluid regularly to prevent deterioration and harmful substances.</p>

        <h4>1.laser beam cutting</h4>
        <h5>SUS890L stainless steel material</h5>
        <p>Laser cutting is suitable for a variety of stainless steel materials, because the laser can quickly melt the metal 
        <br>surface to achieve precise cutting.</p>

        <h4>2.CNC Machining</h4>
        <h5>Hard alloy cutter</h5>
        <p>Due to the high hardness of stainless steel, carbide tools are usually used in CNC machining to improve cutting 
        <br>efficiency and tool life.</p>

        <h3 id="subsection5-2">5-2 Equipment introduction</h3>
        <p>CNC machine tool is a highly automated machining equipment, which can control the path of tool movement and 
        <br>machining parameters through pre-programmed instructions. Common CNC machine types include vertical machining 
        <br>centers, horizontal machining centers, lathes, and so on. These machines are often equipped with multiple axes, 
        <br>enabling multi-directional machining of complex parts.</p>
        <img src="./cc-5/cc-5-3.png">
        <img src="./cc-5/cc-5-4.png">
        <h4>The main components of a CNC machine include:</h4>
        <p><b>Control system: </b>Receive and execute machining procedures and control all machine movements.
        <br><b>Servo motor: </b>Drive each axis of the machine to move, to achieve accurate position control.
        <br><b>Principal axis: </b>The part of the installation tool can be rotated at high speed for cutting.
        <br><b>Workbench: </b>A platform for holding and supporting workpieces.
        <br>In practice, the appearance of a CNC machine is usually a closed or semi-closed metal structure with precision 
        <br>mechanical components and electronic control systems inside. The operation panel has a display screen and operation 
        <br>buttons for inputting instructions and monitoring the processing status.</p>
