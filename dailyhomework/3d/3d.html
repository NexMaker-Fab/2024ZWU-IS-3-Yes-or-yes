    <h4>1.1 Precision electronic device</h4>
    <p>With the deepening popularization of high-end application scenarios such as 5G communication for the Internet of 
    <br>everything and new energy vehicles, miniaturization, precision and integrated precision electronic device 
    <br>innovation is imperative to meet the needs of large-capacity data transmission and high-speed and high-density 
    <br>signal transmission. Miniaturization, increasing number of devices and communication density, and design trends 
    <br>for faster transmission speeds are some of the challenges facing electronic device manufacturing today. With the 
    <br>advent of high-precision 3D printing, direct 3D printing of electronic devices is becoming a viable alternative 
    <br>to traditional manufacturing processes.</p>
    <p>For example: optical fiber connector</p>

    <h4>1.2 Precision medical instrument</h4>
    <p>With the improvement of the economic living standards of Chinese residents, the awareness of medical care has 
    <br>gradually strengthened, so the demand for precision medical equipment products is also rising. The development 
    <br>trend of medical devices in the future will become more and more micro and precise, which makes the manufacturing 
    <br>cost and manufacturing cycle more and more high. Miniaturization, integration and precision are the future 
    <br>development trends, which will bring great challenges to traditional manufacturing methods.</p>

    <h4>The research group of Professor He Rujie from Beijing Institute of Technology "JAC" : 
    <br>3D printing accuracy and mechanical properties of precursor conversion SiOC ceramic 
    <br>microlattice structures</h4>
    <p>The precursor converted SiOC ceramic material (PDC-SiOC) has excellent oxidation resistance, thermal stability 
    <br>and mechanical properties, and is expected to be used as high temperature resistant materials for aerospace. In 
    <br>recent years, lattice structures with artificially designed periodic structures have become one of the research 
    <br>hotspots in the field of structural mechanics because of their excellent mechanical properties. However, the 
    <br>traditional machining method is difficult to realize the high precision manufacturing of complex PDC-SiOC lattice 
    <br>structures. 3D printing can realize the integrated molding of complex structural ceramic materials, especially in 
    <br>the field of complex ceramic lattice structure manufacturing has shown great advantages. Among them, the light 
    <br>curing 3D printing technology has the highest molding accuracy and is suitable for the high-precision manufacturing 
    <br>of PDC-SiOC lattice structures. However, on the one hand, there are still many limitations on the manufacturing 
    <br>accuracy and mechanical properties of PDC-SiOC ceramic lattice structure 3D printing, and the structural feature 
    <br>size is generally several hundred microns. With the development of PDC-SiOC structures and devices toward 
    <br>miniaturization, the feature size is usually less than 100 μm or even smaller, although there are currently 
    <br>extremely high precision 3D printing methods such as two-photon lithography, but the size of the prepared materials 
    <br>is too small and difficult to apply. On the other hand, the reported PDC-SiOC lattice structures have weak 
    <br>mechanical properties, and their compressive strength is generally only 0.06 ~ 10MPa. It is urgent to carry out 
    <br>research on the structure of PDC-SiOC microlattice with high precision and high strength 3D printing.</p>

    <h4>Part A</h4>
    <P><b>;TYPE:WALL-INNER</b>
    <br>WALL-INNER refers to the instruction to print an internal wall, which usually means that the print head will move 
    <br>in the inner wall area, forming a closed internal structure. This type of path is often used to create print 
    <br>objects with internal support or padding.</P>
    <P>Another:
    <br><b>;TYPE:WALL-OUTER</b>
    <br>;TYPE:WALL-OUTER refers to the part of the outer wall during the printing process. In 3D printing, outer walls are 
    <br>layers or layers of material that surround the outside of the printed object, protecting the internal structure 
    <br>and enhancing the overall strength.
    <br><b>;TYPE:SKIN</b>
    <br>;TYPE:SKIN in Gcode files usually refers to the surface layer or overlay of the printed model. In 3D printing, a 
    <br>skin layer is an added layer or layers of material beyond the outer walls of a model that can provide additional 
    <br>protection, improve appearance, or meet specific mechanical properties requirements.
    </P>
    <h4>Part B</h4>
    <P><b>G1:</b>This is a straight line move instruction that tells the CNC machine to make a straight line cut along a 
    <br>specified path at a given speed.</P>
    <p><b>F39977.9:</b>This is a speed parameter that indicates the feed rate at which the G1 instruction is executed, 
    <br>usually in millimeters per minute.</p>
    <p><b>X96.486:</b>This is a coordinate parameter that represents the end position of the move on the X-axis.</p>
    <p><b>Y105.287：</b>This is another coordinate parameter that represents the moving endpoint position on the Y-axis.</p>
    <P><b>E0.01536:</b>This is a movement parameter of the extrusion axis (E axis), which represents the amount of 
    <br>extruded material when performing the cut.</P>
