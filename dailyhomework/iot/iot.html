        <section id="subsection2-1"><h3>2-1 Sensor network</h3>
        <p><b>Examples: </b>Ambient light sensor、Temperature sensor、 Humidity sensor、Air quality sensors、
        <br>Eye-tracking sensor、Vehicle running status sensor、Health sensors、Camera sensor、 
        <br>Ultrasonic sensors、Infrared sensor、Sound sensorAmbient light sensor、Temperature sensor、 
        <br>Humidity sensor、Air quality sensors、Eye-tracking sensor、Vehicle running status sensor、
        <br>Health sensors、Camera sensor、 Ultrasonic sensors、Infrared sensor、Sound sensor</p>
        <h4>Interior temperature sensor:</h4>
        <p>The temperature sensor in the car is a thermistor with a negative temperature coefficient, and the 
        <br>resistance value of the thermistor will gradually decrease as the temperature value increases. The 
        <br>temperature sensor in the car is an important information input component of the automatic air 
        <br>conditioning, which is used to detect the temperature in the car to control the work of the air 
        <br>conditioning system. When the temperature inside the car changes, the resistance value of the 
        <br>thermistor changes, thereby conveying the temperature signal inside the car to the air conditioning 
        <br>ECU. It can affect the air temperature of the outlet, the air volume of the outlet, the position 
        <br>of the mode damper, and the position of the internal and external circulation damper.</p>
        <img src="./IOT-2/IOT-2-1.png">
        <p>Some temperature sensors in the car are installed inside the instrument panel, and there are special 
        <br>grille port installation positions; Some are mounted on the control panel.</p>
        <img src="./IOT-2/IOT-2-2.png">
        <h4>Ultrasonic sensor:</h4>
        <p>Ultrasonic sensor is a device that uses ultrasonic signal for distance measurement and obstacle 
        <br>detection. They calculate the distance from the transmitting point to the obstacle by transmitting 
        <br>ultrasonic signals and receiving the signals reflected back by the obstacle. Because ultrasonic 
        <br>sensors are insensitive to color, light and electromagnetic fields, they can work effectively in 
        <br>the dark, smoke, dust, and electromagnetic interference environment.</p>
        <img src="./IOT-2/IOT-2-3.png">
        <p>Brake assistance: Ultrasonic sensors can help the driver accurately judge the distance to the vehicle 
        <br>or obstacles in front of the vehicle, if the distance is too close, the vehicle will issue a warning, 
        <br>some smart cars can also automatically slow down or stop, effectively prevent traffic accidents.</p>
        <img src="./IOT-2/iot-2-5.jpg">
        <p>Automated parking: Ultrasonic sensors play a key role in automated parking systems, measuring the 
        <br>distance between the vehicle and surrounding obstacles and assisting the vehicle to enter the 
        <br>parking space safely and smoothly.</p>
        <p>Parking Assist Systems (PAS) : PAS systems use ultrasonic sensors to measure the vehicle's distance from 
        <br>obstacles and notify the driver of proximity, helping the driver avoid collisions or bruises.</p>

        <p>1.Data acquisition: Sensors collect temperature data in the car and convert it into electrical signals.
        <br>2.Signal conversion: The analog signal received by the central processing system usually needs to be 
        <br>converted into a digital signal by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for computer processing. Data 
        <br>processing: The digital signal is processed by a microprocessor or microcontroller to calculate the 
        <br>current temperature value.
        <br>3.Data analysis: The processed data may be compared with preset temperature thresholds to determine 
        <br>whether the operation of the air conditioning system needs to be adjusted.</p>
        <p><b>Common ways of storing data:</b></p>
        <p>1.Temporary storage: Processed data may be temporarily stored in memory for real-time monitoring and 
        <br>processing.
        <br>2.Long-term storage: If it is necessary to record historical data on temperature changes, this data 
        <br>may be stored in the vehicle's permanent memory, such as flash memory or hard drive.
        <br>3.Cloud storage: In some modern vehicles, data may be uploaded to a cloud server for remote access and 
        <br>analysis.</p>
        <p><b>Technical requirements for data processing and storage:</b></p>
        <p>1.Accuracy: The temperature sensor must have high precision to ensure the accuracy of temperature data.
        <br>2.Speed of response: Sensors and processing systems must be able to respond quickly to temperature 
        <br>changes in order to adjust the air conditioning system in a timely manner.
