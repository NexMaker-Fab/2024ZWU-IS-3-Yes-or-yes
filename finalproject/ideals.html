        <p>Emotional Guardian Wearable and Doll is an emotional control device that uses advanced sensor technology to monitor 
        <br>and analyze the user's physiological data in real time, converting these data into indicators of emotional state. 
        <br>The core goal of the device is to help people better recognize and manage their mood swings and improve their quality 
        <br>of life. Using precise measurements from heart rate monitors, skin temperature sensors and skin conductivity sensors, 
        <br>it accurately captures the user's mood changes. When a negative emotion is identified, the device alerts the user with 
        <br>soft light and relaxing music, connects to the doll, and provides relaxation guidance and voice prompts for breathing 
        <br>exercises to help the user quickly calm down.
        </p>
    <section id="subsection1-4"><h3>1.4 Sensors</h3>
        <p>01.Heart rate monitor: measures the user's heart rate, which can effectively reflect changes in emotional states 
        <br>such as tension and excitement.
        <br>02.Skin temperature sensor: captures an increase in body temperature due to stress or anxiety.
        <br>03.Skin conductivity sensor: Measures the activity of sweat glands to further confirm whether the user is in an 
        <br>emotional or stressed state.</p>

        <p>Rainwater collection device:
        <br>To help water-stressed areas in developing countries carry out activities related to water and sanitation, devices 
        <br>for rainwater harvesting and reuse are envisaged.
        <br> 
        <br>Source of rain: roof rain, ground rain, direct rain
        <br> 
        <br>The device is divided into three parts:
        <br>Upper (rain receiving part) : The humidity sensor is connected to the top cover of the device.
        <br>Middle (rainwater filtration part) : multi-layer filtration layer is set to filter the rainwater (disinfection)
        <br>Under (rainwater storage part) : storage rainwater part, install water quality detector.Add faucet outlet 
        <br>(for garden irrigation or washing hands, etc.)
        <br>The upper unit can be separated from the middle and lower part to facilitate the filtration of ground rainwater 
        <br>or other water resources.
        <br> 
        <br>tips: This device can only ensure that the water quality is up to drinking standards, and can be used for laundry, 
        <br>irrigation, or other everyday purposes.</p>
    <section id="subsection2-4"><h3>2.4 Sensors</h3>
        <p>01.Humidity sensor:Connect the top cover of the device, when the humidity is too high, open the cover to receive rain 
        <br>(reduce evaporation or pollution when it is not raining)
        <br>02.Water quality detector: In the storage rainwater part, install water quality detector, green light when the water 
        <br>quality is up to standard, red light when the water quality is not up to standard, reminding people to replace the 
        <br>filter layer
        <br>03.Water level sensor: When the water level below is detected to be too high, send a signal to the top cover to close 
        <br>the cover.</p>

        <p>With the development of The Times and the progress of science and technology, the creatures who share weal and woe with 
        <br>us have also been greatly affected, some are not adapted to the impact of human beings and are on the verge of extinction, 
        <br>and some are completely dependent on human help and reproduction, which is not conducive to the biodiversity of the earth, 
        <br>the earth is the common home of all living things, as human beings, in the rapid development of civilization, we must 
        <br>share weal and woe with the life on earth</p>
    <section id="subsection3-4"><h3>3.4 Sensors</h3>
        <p>01-Water turbidity, pH sensor：
        <br>1. STM32F103CT6 MCU is used as main control.
        <br>2. The PH sensor is converted into a digital display through the internal AD.
        <br>3. Use turbidity sensor to collect water turbidity 4.0.96 "0LED liquid crystal display current TDS, temperature, PH and 
        <br>turbidity data.
        <br>02-Temperature and humidity detection and alarm system：
        <br>1.The temperature and humidity sensor uses DHT11. The temperature ranges from 0 to 50 degrees, and the humidity ranges 
        <br>from 10% to 95%RH.
        <br>2.There are four indicators, indicating that the temperature is too low, the temperature is too high, the humidity is 
        <br>too low, and the humidity is too high. The buzzer alarms and the corresponding indicator lights up.When the temperature 
        <br>is too high, the analog cooling device starts and the relay controls the rotation of the small fan.
        <br>03-Total monitoring and control system：
        <br>1.OLED screen displays temperature, water level and water quality.
        <br>2. The DS18B20 temperature sensor measures the temperature. When the temperature is too low, it heats up and stops heating 
        <br>when the heating reaches the upper limit.
        <br>3. Water level detector, water level is too low automatically add water, water to reach the upper limit stop adding water. 
        <br>Water quality tds test triggers automatic water change.
        <br>4. Light sensor detects light and automatically fills LED fill lighting.
        <br>5. Connect to the cloud platform through Wi-Fi, send remote data to the mobile phone, and view data and remote control.

        <p>Blood sugar grip tester ：As aging becomes more and more serious, diabetes has become a major health problem for the elderly, 
        <br>our blood glucose meters today require needles, and elderly people living alone are difficult to complete this operation alone. 
        <br>In order to measure and solve this problem, a blood glucose grip tester for the elderly was designed, which can detect blood 
        <br>glucose levels through infrared sensors, thus eliminating the need for blood collection. In addition, the device is equipped 
        <br>with sensors that can monitor the elderly's grasp and handshake ability to detect whether they are healthy.</p>

        <p>cutlery detector:As the elderly are alone at home and do not pay attention to healthy diet, they often eat overnight meals, 
        <br>which has a great impact on their health. The design of the cutlery food detector can sniff out the gas released by rotten 
        <br>food and monitor whether the food is spoiled according to its freshness with a sensor on the upper end of the cutlery handle. 
        <br>If the food goes bad, the cutlery detector will vibrate to warn the display above the cutlery to emit a red light. If very 
        <br>fresh, it will glow green.
