    <h3>1-Look for sutures</h3>
    <p>The suture line is found on the head of the stuffed toy bear, because the suture line is easy to 
    <br>disassemble and sew the bear and the head space of the bear is large to accommodate various parts 
    <br>of the circuit module.</p>
    <img src="./pc-1/pc-1-1.jpg">
    <h3>2-Remove the sutures</h3>
    <p>Pull back the pile near the suture to prevent further work from getting in the way. Use a knife 
    <br>to carefully cut the yarn from the suture, pulling the fabric apart bit by bit.</p>

    <h3>3-Take out the cotton</h3>
    <p>Separate the fabric from the head of the stuffed bear and remove all the cotton from the bear.</p>

    <section id="section2"><h2>Step2: Stitching zipper</h2> 
    <h3>1-Stores reserve</h3>
    <p><b>Before we start working on the teddy bear, we need to prepare a series of tools and materials: 
    <br>sewing kit, invisible zipper and thread.</b></p>
    <p><b>sewing kit：</b>First came the sewing kit, which contained two small needles of different sizes, 
    <br>three white buttons, two small pins, and a small pair of scissors.In addition.
    <br><b>invisible zipper：</b>Five 10cm invisible zippers, the length of the teddy bear's head suture line.
    <br><b>thread：</b>A bundle of light brown thread, the same color as the teddy bear.</p>
    <img src="./pc-2/pc-2-1.jpg">
    <h3>2-Locate zipper</h3>
    <p>Take out a zipper and place it at the stitching line of the teddy bear's head to determine the 
    <br>stitching position corresponding to the zipper and the fabric to ensure that the subsequent 
    <br>stitching and zipper use smoothly.</p>
    <img src="./pc-2/pc-2-2.jpg">
    <h3>3-Zipper mounting</h3>
    <p>Take a light brown thread of a suitable length, thread it through the pinhole and tie it at the end 
    <br>of the thread.Thread the needle through the zipper and the fabric at the point, and then use the 
    <br>back stitch method to sew one side of the zipper to the fabric, and then sew the other side, and 
    <br>finally tie the knot.</p>

    <section id="section3"><h2>Step3: Module connection</h2>
    <h3>1-The display and RGB lights need to be fixed to the bear, 
    <br>so the two parts are connected separately.</h3>
    <h3>1-1 The connection between the display and the teddy bear</h3>
    <p>Place the monitor on the bear's chest to determine its position and mark it.Using scissors to cut along 
    <br>the mark made, you can see that there is a gap in the fabric of the teddy bear's chest to fit the 
    <br>display screen.Apply a circle of nylon glue next to the notch and immediately install the display and 
    <br>let it sit for a few seconds.</p>
    <img src="./pc-3/pc-3-1.jpg">
    <h3>1-2 The connection between the RGB light and the teddy bear</h3>
    <p>Because the bear's nose fabric is thin and light in color, the installation of RGB light components is 
    <br>convenient, so it is very suitable for placing lamp beads. Cut the inside of the bear to sew the nose, 
    <br>insert the lamp bead, and sew the fabric only to leave a small gap to fit through the dupont thread.</p>
    <img src="./pc-3/pc-3-2.jpg">
    <h3>1-3 precautionary measure</h3>
    <p>After placing each part of the electronic components in turn inside the bear, after our inspection and 
    <br>analysis, there is a large area of exposure at the welding of the dupont wire and electronic components, 
    <br>which is likely to short-circuit due to extrusion collision, and the subsequent filling of the cotton 
    <br>wool will be conductive. In order to prevent such accidents, we use electrical tape to close the welding 
    <br>place and the exposed part of the circuit, and tie the wires of the same module together.</p>
    <img src="./pc-3/pc-3-3.jpg">
    <h3>2-Some modules and Arduino boards are not directly connected 
    <br>with the bear, and are placed in acrylic boxes to avoid direct 
    <br>exposure of the line and contact with cotton.</h3>
    <h3>2-1 Drill hole</h3>
    <p>We choose a small plastic box to place the arduino board, determine the position of the wire through the 
    <br>box, and drill the position of these marks with an electric drill.</p>
    <img src="./pc-3/pc-3-4.jpg">
    <h3>2-2 Sawing</h3>
    <p>Use a saw to cut away the excess above the drill hole.</p>
    <img src="./pc-3/pc-3-5.jpg">
    <h3>2-3 After finishing the box</h3>
    <p>Put the arduino components into the processed box, pass the lines through the holes on the side of the box, 
    <br>and sort out the components inside the box. After completion, the figure is shown.</p>
