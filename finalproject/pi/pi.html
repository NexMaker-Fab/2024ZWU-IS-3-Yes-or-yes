    <section id="section2"><h2>02 Main function</h2> 
    <p>The project designed a cuddle doll that can gauge stress levels by sensing how hard the user is 
    <br>hugging.
    <br>When the user's stress level is detected to be too high, the doll automatically plays relaxing 
    <br>music and provides breathing guidance to help the user relax and de-stress.</p>
    <section id="section3"><h2>03 Project addresses problem points</h2> 
    <p>The project aims to address the stress problem prevalent in modern society and provide an innovative 
    <br>and interactive solution. Through the design of the hug doll, the project encourages users to pay 
    <br>more attention to their emotional and stressful states in their daily lives and take proactive 
    <br>steps to manage and relieve them.
    <br>The project also helps users relax more effectively and improve their quality of life by providing 
    <br>features such as soothing music and breathing guidance. At the same time, for special groups such 
    <br>as people with autism, the project also provides additional emotional support.</p>
    <section id="section4"><h2>04 Target group</h2>
